# Sorting_vizualizer_project
The project is built out of python and uses the tkinter module to visualize the way 3 of the most popular sorting algorithms works. The algorithms visualized are:

Insertion Sort

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort
 I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action.
